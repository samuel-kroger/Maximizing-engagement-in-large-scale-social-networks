# Integer programming formulations for maximizing resilience in large-scale social networks

Codes, data, and results for "Integer programming formulations for maximizing resilience in large-scale social networks" by Samuel Kroger, Hamidreza Validi, and Illya V. Hicks.

Here are two IP formulations for radius-bounded anchored k-core.

The max k-cut problem is easy to be explained, but hard to be solved: How to color the nodes of a graph with at most k colors such that the number of edges with distinct colored endpoints is maximized?
